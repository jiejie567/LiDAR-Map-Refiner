## GUI Opens but Point Clouds Look Wrong

Check:

- whether the selected session has the correct `g2o`, `TUM`, and `key_point_frame` files
- whether `source` and `target` are selected in the intended order
- whether the point-cloud mode is `Temporal Window` or `RS Spatial Submap`

## Python Optimizer Not Available

Run:

```bash
python scripts/check_env.py
```

and verify that Python GTSAM can be imported.

## Exported Map Too Sparse

Check the export map voxel in `Advanced`.

- `0.0` means no export downsampling
- values larger than `0.0` will reduce map density

## Session Browser Opens at Home

The GUI remembers the last successful session path. If it still resets unexpectedly, verify that the session was actually loaded successfully before reopening the file dialog.

## A PALoc Session Fails Because `g2o` Has One Extra Vertex

Symptoms often look like:

- `pose_graph.g2o` has `N+1` vertices
- `optimized_poses_tum.txt` has `N` rows
- `key_point_frame/*.pcd` has `N` files

The current GUI now handles the simple case where the extra g2o vertex is just a trailing unmatched vertex.

If you still see a load failure:

- make sure you are not reusing a stale `g2o` path from another session
- reload the PALoc session root directly
- if possible, regenerate the PALoc export after fixing PALoc's save path so `g2o`, `TUM`, and PCD counts match exactly
