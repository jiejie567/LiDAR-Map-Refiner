## Editing Philosophy

The tool distinguishes between:

- adding a new manual loop
- replacing an existing loop edge
- disabling an existing loop edge
- restoring a disabled edge

## Add Manual Loop

Use this when the graph does not already contain the constraint you want.

Workflow:

1. pick a source / target pair
2. refine the initial pose if necessary
3. run GICP
4. verify the result in the viewer
5. click `Add`

After `Add`, the current GICP candidate is consumed. If you change the seed, delta, or map settings, run GICP again before accepting another edit.

## Replace Existing Loop

Use this when an existing loop edge is present but unreliable.

Workflow:

1. switch to `Edges`
2. select the existing loop
3. run GICP from the current preview seed
4. click `Replace`

After `Replace`, the current GICP candidate is also consumed, so the button disables again until a fresh GICP run is available.

Internally this keeps the original graph untouched, disables the selected existing loop in the working graph, and applies the new manual result instead.

## Disable / Restore

- `Disable` removes an existing loop from the working graph only.
- `Restore` brings the disabled loop back into the working graph.

## Export Behavior

Export is based on the working graph state after optimization.

This means:

- disabled loops are excluded
- replacement loops are exported through the accepted working graph state
- original input files are not overwritten
- `Optimize` updates the working graph first and defers heavy map rebuilding
- `Export` builds `scans.pcd` and `trajectory.pcd` only when needed

## Project Logs and Replay

Each edit project now writes:

- `project_state.json`
- `execution.log`
- `operations.jsonl`

This makes it possible to:

- review what was changed during a manual editing session
- reopen the latest project with `Load Session`
- reopen a specific old project with `Resume Project`

## Run vs Export

- `manual_loop_runs/` stores the actual optimization outputs
- `manual_loop_exports/` stores a lightweight export manifest that points to one selected run

So `Export` no longer duplicates the full run directory again.
By design, the heavy map rebuild step is also delayed until `Export`.
